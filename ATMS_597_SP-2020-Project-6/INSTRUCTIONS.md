# ATMS 597 SP 2020
## Project 6 - Deep Learning (version 1.0)

### Due Wednesday, May 6, at midnight

You will work in groups of 3 to complete this assignment.  You will sign up into groups of 3 (one group of 2 possible); the sign up sheet is available on Learn@Illinois. Students who are not taking the course for credit may join to form their own groups, however their assignment will not be graded.

Tasks: Use a deep neural network (i.e., it should contain at least 3 layers) to perform a classification or regression task using TensorFlow-Keras.  You can use any dataset that you want for this problem.  This could be a dataset related to your research, one that we used in class (i.e., weather prediction, snow separation, vorticity/hail prediction example), or some other weather and climate related dataset.  

Create a test-validation split and test your deep neural network model against a baseline model using a model technique we have already developed in class to show how well the neural network model compares quantitatively with the baseline model you choose.  For example, you could use the weather prediction example, and compare the neural network with the random forest regression model you developed as a baseline.  Be sure to report quantitative metrics such as root mean square error or Briar Skill Score comparing how the models perform. 

Course presentations will be Tuesday, May 5.

Good luck!
